🚀🚀GOOD-FOOD Application🚀🍕

This is an Food-delivery application named as GOOD-FOOD😊. I made it using popular JavaScript library famously known as React-Js. I also used tailwind-css for styling my applications . For routing I used react-router-dom to route from one page to another (React follows the principle of Single-page-Application). For state management i.e. passing data I have used Redux-toolkit along with React-Redux.

Please check this Application, I am to open to feedbacks

Thank you..
